The base project is forked from https://github.com/ToughNutToCrack/ProceduralIvy 
Before pushing to bitbucket I added 2 free assets:
-  https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/desert-stone-ground-def353b3968947d496a51f3783cd6eaa
- https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/post-apocalyptic-building-3085571b81d34c978f8a30582d0ba072
and made a scene with these 3D assets using procedural ivy content from the original project.
